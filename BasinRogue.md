# Introduction #

> There should be a roguelike game hosted on Roguebasin. Either playable over the web, or some kind of client/server model.

> It should be developed by RGRD regulars, with everyone welcome to contribute code and/or data.

> It should have lots of injokes (shopkeepers named after RGRD regulars, fortune cookies with RGRDers' signatures, etc).

> It should allow for interaction between players in some way - I don't necessarily mean the @s wandering round the screen together killing monsters, but perhaps you might be able to chat to other players. Or trade or sell items. And everyone should be on the same high score ladder. And then perhaps there might be some quests, which the first person to complete the quest would get some bonus.

# Details #

The game, as in most roguelikes will be composed of an @ that wanders between the [Town](Town.md) and the [Dungeon](Dungeon.md). The [Player](Player.md) will have to make use of his [Magic](Magic.md) and of the [Items](Items.md) he finds in the [Dungeon](Dungeon.md) to defeat the many dangers that lurk in the shadows : [Monsters](Monsters.md), [Traps](Traps.md), [Mazes](Mazes.md) etc...
