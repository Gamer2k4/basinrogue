#summary Are artifacts truly unique?

Pros:
  * Artifacts have increased value and uniqueness
  * Artifacts are important events in the short life of a typical @

Cons:
  * Experienced players ( and less experienced ) could hoard artifacts
  * Many artifacts required to maintain 'freshness'
  * Artifacts do not scale well in a multiplayer game: the more players, the more different artifacts are needed to maintain the same ratio of artifact per player.
