#summary When we have the game running, what will be involved in administering it?

(A.)

Account issues (lost passwords etc)

Restoring characters in the event of a crash or bug

Penalising/deleting rulebreakers (?)

Dealing with complaints (hate speech over chat, etc)

Receiving RFEs and bugreports

Occasional shutdowns to install updates

In-game testing using some kind of wizard mode

...?

(Konijn) Well, I am just a humble developer. I'll do RFE's, bugreports, shutdowns/reboots and ingame testing. I _love_ wizard mode.
