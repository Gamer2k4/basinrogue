#summary The display question; do we want primarily ASCII or primarily tiles?

(Antoine:) *Are we primarily thinking ASCII or tiles?* I mean, I suppose we should support both, but which should be primary? I think the big impact is on mapsize - if tiles are primary, then the map should arguably be somewhat small; if ASCII is primary, the map can be bigger but tile users would then have to use a scrolling main window... 

(Gamer_2k4:) I'd say SDL tiles. I think Radomir volunteered to do graphics at some point, and until then, we can use bitmaps of ASCII characters. 

(Konijn) Whatever the majority says,I am more interested in the server side anyway ;)
However, follow up question : 

*scrollable maps : yes , no, later.*
Towers of Doom is a nice experience without scrolling maps.

(A.) My suggestion would be 'no' with ASCII - aim to fit the whole map on one screen - and 'yes but later' for tiles.

(C.) Does ASCII mean a 80x25 screen? Because with simple 16x16 tiles, you can display 40x30 tiles in a simple 640x480 screen which is less horizontaly, but more verticaly than text mode. If we go for non scrolling text mode, we end up with a huge waste of vertical space on tile mode later + a lot of horizontal scrolling.

(Konijn) I would start with a 25*25 screen, more in the likings of the Lost Labyrint. Less profiling will then be needed in the beginning to have a reasonable game.

(A.) That's the screensize I'm using for my in-dev game.  It works and is good for graphics but it sure is small.

(G2k4) How about 40x40?  That way you get the same amount of tiles as you would in fullscreen ascii.
