Antoine is a regulator in the electricity industry, who likes to work on roguelikes in his spare time (when not attending Mrs Antoine, who is lovely apart from her habit of referring to RGRD as 'really geeky, really dorky').

His gaming interests include

- RPGs - D&D, Vampires the Masquerade, Cyberpunk, freeform

- Play-by-mail fantasy strategy games

- Jyhad (the Vampires tradable card game)

- Roguelikes - Guild (now mothballed), Quickband (released, doing well, apparently under development by Pete M from RGRA), and an as-yet-unnamed Python graphical roguelike

- Board games from time to time.
