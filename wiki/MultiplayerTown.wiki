#summary Issues pertaining to the mechanics of a level designed for community interaction

Some of the issues that we currently have:
  * Should the town be real-time or turn-based?
  * How should trading occur?  Possible options:
    * Abstracted - anything sold to a shop is available to everyone else
    * Indirect - one player drops, another player picks up
    * Direct - a trade window opens, trade occurs simultaneously
  * Are houses necessary? If so, what limitations are on them (cost, space, etc.)?
  * Multiplayer, multiuser, or simply online?
    * Multiplayer - real-time gameplay, shared levels, artifacts, uniques, stores
    * Multiuser - turn-based gameplay, shared artifacts, uniques, possibly shared town
    * Online - like a single player game, with chatting and shared high scores
