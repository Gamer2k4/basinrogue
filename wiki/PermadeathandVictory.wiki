#summary Two big issues.

Do we want permadeath? MUDs don't have it and Mangband doesn't have it. But I think we should have it. What do you guys think?
  * G2k4: Permadeath is good, IMO.  My vision of this was always something like the online version of Nethack, only unique objects are shared.
  * Konijn: Yes!

Do we want to have a victory condition (e.g. kill Morgoth) after which your character gets retired? Or do we want to have a more MUD-like scenario where your characters just hang round forever getting tougher and doing minor quests along the way?
  * G2k4: How about we have an initial boss monster, then every player who kills it becomes the new boss monster?  The contents of his house would be regenerated throughout the dungeon, his high score would be saved, and the new monster would have all of his stats and equipment.
  * Konijn: I was thinking amulet of Yendor but with a set of armor, so that multiple people can find pieces. Then ( as with powerful items in Elder Scrolls ) every few weeks the pieces go wandering so other people can find them. Finding a piece would be the same effort as finding the amulet of Yendor.
    * G2k4: So separate bosses? Maybe a different boss for each class?  A set of equipment, worn by the legendary adventurer before he was consumed by the darkness?  Yes...I think I can make a story out of this.
