#summary We don't have a server, and some of us wouldn't know what to do if we did

We have no test server! 
  * G2k4: How about this? http://www.soldatforums.com/index.php?topic=9986.0  I know a guy who knows a guy...
  * C.: Price?
  * G2k4: I sent the host an email.  I'll let you know the price ASAP, then you can discuss technical details with him.
  * A.: What came of this in the end?


What kind of authentication would we use?
  (C.) Standard procedure as follows : client sends it's username to the server. Server knows the expected password. Server generates a random string of sufficient length ( 20 should be more than enouth ) to the client. The client concatenates his password to that string and computes the MD5 sum of the resulting string ( replace MD5 with SHA as appropriate ) and sends it back to the server. Server checks that the MD5 is the same as the one it computed on it's own.
  
  (Konijn) Like he says.


How would a user create an account?
  (C.) Either on the client or a forced passage on a dynamic web site. I would go for the former I think. That way you don't have to install and administer a HTTP server at the same time as the game server to get the game working. It doesn't mean such interaction would be impossible, just not required.

  (Konijn) Yes, we should definitely go with the client.
