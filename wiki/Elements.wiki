#summary Every roguelike has elements, except maybe Rogue.

= On Elements =

Elements can be either used by @ , monsters , traps or weapons or wand/staff/rod. Did I forget anything ?
  * G2k4: In my RPG, I planned the following system to deal with spells and item creation:
    * Wands - Attack, Morph spells.  Made of metal and wood.
    * Staffs - Protection, Healing spells.  Made two types of wood.
    * Rods - Movement, Divination spells.  Made of two types of metal.
    * Talismans - Mind spells.  Made of metal, wood, and stone.
    * Rings - Morph, Movement, Attack spells.  Made of metal and a gem.
    * Amulets - Healing, Protection, Divination spells.  Made of stone and a gem.

There should be unresistable elements, elements only monsters can resists, 


= List of elements, add/remove as you wish  =

 * Fire, Cold
 * Light, Dark
 * Poison
 * Body, Mind
 * Air, Earth
 * Shock

G2k4: My brother comes up with some pretty crazy elements in things he works on, like Void, Entropy, Gravity, Order, and other things like that.  I'll ask him for a list sometime.  Also, It would be cool if elements followed a large rock, paper, scissors pattern, like
  * Earth > Shock > Water > Fire > Ice > Rock > Wind > Plants > Earth (yes, earth and rock are different.  Yes, the last three weren't really good.  But it's tricky making these lists)
  * Another option is combinable elements:
    * Light + Darkness = Twilight
    * Heat + Water = Steam
    * Cold + Earth = Frost
    * Air + Earth = Dust
    * Air + Water = Mist
    * Heat + Earth = Magma
    * Shock + Air = Storm
    * etc.
