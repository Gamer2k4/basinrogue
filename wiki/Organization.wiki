= Introduction =

You may have noticed that the Wiki has been cannibalized into Issues, this is because issues follow a more forum or usenet-like discussion format, while the Wiki is more fitting for finalized design documentation.

I have therefore moved all of the tentative, unfinalized discussions to issues to make them easier to tackle, and left the finalized entries in the Wiki. Of course, as design issues are resolved they will be closed and upgraded to the Wiki.

= Labels =

You will notice that you may apply labels to your entries for both the Wiki and the Issues. Please do so to keep the project neatly organized :)
