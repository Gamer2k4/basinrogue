#summary Build instructions.

= Windows =

Here is how I build the Windows version. First, make sure that all [Requirements] are installed of course.

  * Open a terminal and change directory into the basinrogue\cpp folder.
  * Make sure that SDLDIR, SDLIMAGEDIR and SDLNETDIR point to the install path of the development versions of those libs.
    _Bug in CMake 2.4.6 : CMake might not find correction SDL_net because of a bug in the detect script. To work around that bug, set both SDLNETDIR and SDLNET to point to the SDL_net install path_
  * Type the <cmake .> command. There should be no errors.
  * Build using NMake

Alternatively, you can run cmake with the -G "Visual Studio 8 2005" for example, open the corresponding Visual Studio project and build from here.

= Unix or MacOS X =

  * Follow the same instructions as in Windows, but you probably do not need to set the Environment vars to point to the SDL libs install path.
    If CMake complains that it cannot find one of the SDL libs, most often it means that your Distro split appart the SDL lib package header files into a separate devel package. Check your distrop package manager for those additional installs.
