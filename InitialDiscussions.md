# Discussions of technology, content, development approach and communication #

# Technology #
  * Thin client but with a telnet option in the back of our head
  * C++
  * SVN for accessing our code repository

# TimeZones #
  * **Antoine** is in Wellington, NZ (GMT + 13)
  * **Konijn** is in New York (GMT - 5)
  * **Christophe** ( Cavalaria Christophe ) is in France (GMT + 1)
  * **Gamer\_2k4** is in Wisconsin (GMT - 6)
  * **Nolithius** is in Miami (GMT - 5)

# Communication #
Wiki seems like the way to go;
We can also use IRC, Email or IM but remember to copy into the Wiki any important information.

# Roles #
  * Gamer\_2k4 will initially set up a story line, then contribute code as needed
  * Konijn will be a C++ meddler
  * Antoine happy to do either/both of above
  * Christophe : primary coder


  * Proposal by Gamer\_2k4:
    * Team Leader: Antoine
    * Lead Programmer: Christophe
    * Administrator: Konijn
    * Design: Gamer\_2k4
    * Documentation: Nolithius
    * Go-to Guy: Cassilda (I dunno...got a specific title you want?)

I'm not saying that I'm the only one coming up with ideas, or Christophe is the only one coding, or Konijn is the only one to find bugs, or Antoine gets to tell everyone what to do.  But I thought it would be nifty to have titles instead of vague job descriptions.

  * Counter proposal by Antoine (somewhat tongue in cheek):
    * Lead Programmer: Christophe
    * Sinister Storyline Wrangler: Gamer\_2k4
    * Most unpronounceably named Guy: Konijn
    * Name most like a prehistoric era Guy: Nolithius
    * Guy who can actually program in real life: Cassilda
    * Why don't we start over again in Python Guy: Antoine
